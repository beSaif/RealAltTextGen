![Real Alt Text Generator Demo Video](demo.gif)

This Chrome extension aims to improve web accessibility by providing a convenient way to generate real alt text for images. Alt text, also known as alternative text, is a textual description that is read by screen readers to provide a meaningful understanding of the images to users with visual impairments.

The Real Alt Text Genie extension leverages the power of the OFA-Image-Captioning model to generate accurate alt text for images. It utilizes the API provided by [https://ofa-sys-ofa-image-caption.hf.space/](https://ofa-sys-ofa-image-caption.hf.space/) to generate the alt texts.
